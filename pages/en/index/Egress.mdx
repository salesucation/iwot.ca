### Egress rather than Ingress

- no need for cloud connectivity we run on the edge
- plcs can be on a private vlan without any access to the internet
- if internet connectivity is required it need only be outbound with Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (mqtt)
- message oriented middleware runs without incoming access
- if wan access is down or intermittent still accessible on same lan
- if www access is required, achieved through outbound access to internet only
- HMI access limited to static (compiled) html and websockets only
