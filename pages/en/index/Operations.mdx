### We make operations secure and observable

- our product is an Open Telemetry Receiver for the inter-web of things
- our members build on observability with no code and low code options for autonomous operational control of plcs
- only access to changes through revision control
- distributed observability without exposing plcs themselves
- observability and alerts on business metrics as well as automation metrics
